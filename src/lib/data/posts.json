Learn how systemic therapy can help untangle unhealthy patterns and create space for change.\n\n## Understanding Family Systems\nFamilies are made up of interconnected relationships, and sometimes those relationships develop patterns that stop working. These might show up as recurring arguments, strained communication, or feelings of disconnection.\n\n## How Systemic Therapy Helps\nSystemic therapy works to identify these patterns and help family members understand their roles within them. The goal isn’t to place blame but to explore how small changes can lead to significant improvements in the family dynamic.",
