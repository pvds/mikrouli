I hold a master’s in psychology and study systemic therapy in both countries.\n\nMy experiences with change and adaptation shape my approach—curious, open, and deeply respectful of every person’s unique story.",
            "content": "## About My Practice  \nMikrouli is more than a therapy practice—it’s a space for **exploration, growth, and connection.**  \n\n> Mikrouli comes from the Greek word \"mikros,\" meaning \"small.\" In systemic therapy, it reflects both **a tender, compassionate way to refer to oneself and loved ones** and **how we exist within larger systems.**  \n\nI offer a warm, supportive, and non-judgmental space. Whether you seek therapy for yourself, your relationship, or your family, we explore together what’s happening and how to create meaningful change.  \n\n---\n\n## My Journey into Systemic Therapy\nOriginally from Greece, I earned a psychology degree in Athens and moved to the Netherlands in 2007 for a master’s in health psychology. There, I discovered systemic therapy—rooted in empathy, collaboration, and relational understanding. It highlights patterns shaping our lives rather than viewing individuals in isolation.\n\nI’m drawn to how we connect, grow, and adapt. My curiosity led me to systemic therapy, where healing happens through connection—with ourselves, others, and the systems around us.\n\n---\n\n## My Experience and Approach\nI trained in systemic therapy in the Netherlands and Greece, working with individuals, couples, and families. My approach is practical and collaborative—I help clients explore, gain clarity, and move forward in ways that fit their lives.\n\nAs an expat, I understand cultural transitions and identity shifts. While I work with all clients, I value how change, belonging, and adaptation shape well-being.\n\nI also support a non-profit for adult children of parents with psychological challenges or addictions, reinforcing my belief in resilience, breaking patterns, and rewriting narratives in ways that feel empowering and connected.\n\n---\n\n## Why Systemic Therapy?  \nSystemic therapy looks beyond the individual to the **relationships, patterns, and environments** shaping experiences. Rather than treating challenges as isolated problems, we explore:  \n\n- **How relationships influence emotions and behaviors.**  \n- **What patterns keep repeating, and why?**  \n- **Where small shifts can create meaningful change.**  \n\nThis approach is **not about blame—it’s about understanding.** Together, we uncover perspectives, recognize strengths, and build sustainable solutions.  \n\nSystemic therapy supports **personal growth, relationship improvement, and navigating major life transitions.** It makes sense of emotions and behaviors in connection with your broader life experience, rather than focusing on \"fixing\" individual struggles.  \n\n---\n\n## Therapy as a Journey  \nGrowth happens through small steps, insights, and shifts in perspective. Therapy offers space to **understand yourself better, explore possibilities, and move forward in a way that feels right for you.**  \n\nWhether you’re facing a specific challenge or seeking clarity, therapy provides support, guidance, and new ways of seeing things. You don’t have to go through it alone.\n",
            "outro": "## Taking the First Step  \nStarting therapy is a personal decision, and it’s normal to have questions before making that choice.  \nI offer a **free 15-minute intake session** where we can talk about what’s on your mind, explore whether my approach feels like the right fit, and discuss how therapy might support you. There’s no commitment—just an opportunity to take the first step at your own pace."
