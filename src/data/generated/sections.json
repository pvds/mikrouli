            "content": "Originally from Greece, I earned a psychology degree in Athens and moved to the Netherlands in 2007 for a master’s in health psychology. There, I discovered systemic therapy—rooted in empathy, collaboration, and relational understanding. It highlights patterns shaping our lives rather than viewing individuals in isolation.\n\nI’m drawn to how we connect, grow, and adapt. My curiosity led me to systemic therapy, where healing happens through connection—with ourselves, others, and the systems around us."

My approach is practical and collaborative—I help clients explore, gain clarity, and move forward in ways that fit their lives.\n\nAs an expat, I understand cultural transitions and identity shifts. While I work with all clients, I value how change, belonging, and adaptation shape well-being.\n\nI also support a non-profit for adult children of parents with psychological challenges or addictions, reinforcing my belief in resilience, breaking patterns, and rewriting narratives in ways that feel empowering and connected."

Whether you seek therapy for yourself, your relationship, or your family, we explore together what’s happening and how to create meaningful change.  "

Rather than treating challenges as isolated problems, we explore:  \n\n- **How relationships influence emotions and behaviors.**  \n- **What patterns keep repeating, and why?**  \n- **Where small shifts can create meaningful change.**  \n\nThis approach is **not about blame—it’s about understanding.** Together, we uncover perspectives, recognize strengths, and build sustainable solutions.  \n\nSystemic therapy supports **personal growth, relationship improvement, and navigating major life transitions.** It makes sense of emotions and behaviors in connection with your broader life experience, rather than focusing on \"fixing\" individual struggles.
