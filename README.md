## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Set up a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```env
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<Your Contentful Space ID>
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Your Contentful Access Token>
PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev -- --open
   ```

3. Optionally, run the svelte-check watcher for code checks:
   ```bash
   bun run check:watch
   ```

### Build and Preview

To create a production build:
```bash
bun run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
bun run preview
```

## Scripts

The project includes a range of NPM scripts for common tasks:

- **Development**: Start the development server.
  ```bash
  bun run dev
  ```

- **Build**: Generate a production build.
  ```bash
  bun run build
  ```

- **Check Code Quality**: Lint and check Svelte files.
  ```bash
  bun run check
  ```

- **Fetch Content**: Download and process Contentful data.
  ```bash
  bun run util:content
  ```

- **Generate Favicons**: Create favicon files.
  ```bash
  bun run util:favicons
  ```

## Content Workflow

The website integrates with Contentful to manage content. The process is as follows:

1. **Fetch Content**: The `fetchContent.js` script retrieves data from Contentful using environment variables for authentication. It fetches content types such as `navigation`, `pages`, `services`, and `posts`, and stores them in JSON files in the `src/lib/data/` directory&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

2. **Transform Content**: The `transformContent.js` script processes raw Contentful data into a structured format. This includes resolving relationships, parsing sections, and organizing navigation&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `ci.yml` and managed via GitHub Actions:

1. **Build Job**:
	- Runs on `main` branch pushes and pull requests.
	- Installs dependencies using Bun.
	- Lints and checks code.
	- Fetches content from Contentful (except on pull requests).
	- Builds the project.
	- Uploads the build artifacts.

2. **Deploy Job**:
	- Deploys the site to GitHub Pages using the built artifacts.

Environment secrets such as `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` and `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` are used for secure data fetching during the CI process&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular and organized structure:
