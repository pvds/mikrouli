            "intro": "I’m Eleni Papamikrouli, a systemic therapist working with individuals, couples, and families. Originally from Greece, I’ve been living, studying, and working in the Netherlands since 2007. My own experiences adapting to new environments have deeply influenced my approach to therapy—one rooted in curiosity, openness, and a respect for each person’s unique story.\n",
            "content": "## About My Practice  \nMikrouli is more than just a therapy practice—it’s a space for **exploration, growth, and connection.** \n\n> Mikrouli is the diminutive form of the Greek word \"mikros, meaning \"small.\" In the context of my systemic therapy practice, it holds a dual meaning: __a tender, compassionate way to refer to oneself and loved ones__, and __a reflection of how we all exist as smaller parts within a greater whole__.\n\nI aim to create a warm, supportive, and non-judgmental environment. Whether you’re seeking therapy for yourself, your relationship, or your family, we explore together what’s happening and how to create meaningful change.\n\n---\n\n## About Me  \n\nI’ve always been drawn to the stories that shape our lives—how we connect, grow, and adapt to challenges. My journey into systemic therapy was shaped by this curiosity and guided by a deep belief that healing happens in connection: with ourselves, with others, and with the broader systems we are part of.\n\nOriginally from Greece, I completed my psychology bachelor's in Athens and moved to the Netherlands in 2007 for a master’s in health psychology. That’s where I discovered systemic therapy—an approach that resonated with my values of empathy, collaboration, and relational understanding. Rather than viewing individuals in isolation, systemic therapy brings attention to the patterns and contexts that shape our lives.\n\n### My Experience  \nOver the years, I’ve trained in systemic therapy in both the Netherlands and Greece, gaining insight into **diverse ways of working with individuals, couples, and families.** My approach is thoughtful, practical, and collaborative—I don’t provide quick fixes or one-size-fits-all solutions, but instead, help clients explore possibilities, gain clarity, and find ways forward that truly fit their lives.  \n\nAs an expat myself, I also understand the impact of cultural transitions and the interplay between personal identity and the environments we live in. While my work is not limited to international clients, this experience has given me **a deep appreciation for how change, belonging, and adaptation influence well-being.**  \n\nBeyond my therapy practice, I am also involved with a non-profit organization that supports adult children of parents with psychological challenges or addictions. This work has reinforced my belief in **the power of resilience, the importance of breaking generational patterns, and the possibility of rewriting our stories in ways that feel more empowering and connected.**  \n\n### Life Outside of Therapy  \nOutside of my practice, I’m a mother to a wonderful 7-year-old daughter, a role that continues to **shape my perspective on relationships, growth, and the everyday challenges of balancing personal and professional life.** Parenthood has taught me that we are always learning, adapting, and discovering new aspects of ourselves—something I bring into my work with clients as well.    \n\n---\n\n## My Approach to Therapy  \nTherapy isn’t about finding quick fixes or rigid solutions—it’s about discovering **what works for you.** My approach is:  \n\n- **Collaborative** – We explore your challenges together. You’re the expert in your own life, and I help you uncover insights and possibilities.  \n- **Practical** – Change isn’t just about talking—it’s about taking small, meaningful steps forward in ways that feel manageable.  \n- **Curious and Compassionate** – Therapy is a space to **reflect without judgment** and see your situation with fresh eyes.  \n\nNo single method suits everyone. We tailor each session to your specific situation, ensuring the process supports your unique needs.\n\n---\n\n## Why Systemic Therapy?  \nSystemic therapy looks beyond the individual and focuses on the **relationships, patterns, and environments** that shape our experiences. Instead of seeing challenges as isolated problems, we explore:  \n\n- **How relationships influence emotions and behaviors.**  \n- **What patterns keep repeating, and why?**  \n- **Where small shifts can create meaningful change.**  \n\nThis approach is **not about blame—it’s about understanding.** We work to uncover new perspectives, recognize strengths, and build solutions that feel sustainable.  \n\nSystemic therapy is useful for **personal growth, improving relationships, and navigating major life transitions**. It helps make sense of emotions and behaviors in a way that feels connected to your life as a whole, rather than just focusing on “fixing” individual struggles.  \n\n---\n\n## Therapy as a Journey  \nGrowth doesn’t happen all at once—it happens through small steps, insights, and shifts in perspective. Therapy provides the time and space to **understand yourself better, explore possibilities, and move forward in a way that feels right for you.**  \n\nWhether you’re facing a specific challenge or simply seeking more clarity, therapy can offer support, guidance, and a new way of seeing things. You don’t have to go through it alone.  \n",
            "outro": "## Taking the First Step  \nStarting therapy is a personal decision, and it’s normal to have questions before making that choice.  \nI offer a **free 15-minute intake session** where we can talk about what’s on your mind, explore whether my approach feels like the right fit, and discuss how therapy might support you. There’s no commitment—just an opportunity to take the first step at your own pace."
