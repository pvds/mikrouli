# TODO list

## 1.0.0

### Features

  `sections` content type
- [x] add reference field to page content type to link to services or other 
  pages (can be used to get data like slug but also to facilitate nested 
  navigation and linking)
- [x] implement shortcodes for contentful ~~(like `{{dialog:booking(intake)}}` to 
  include a booking dialog~~ and `{{embed:youtube(https://youtube.com/...)}}` 
  to embed a youtube video)
~~- [ ] explore migrating to mdsvex to allow for svelte components in markdown~~

#### Global

- [ ] **remove disallow from robots route server.js file for production before 
  launching site**
- [x] overwrite default typography (prose) variables, colors for sure
- [ ] consider using custom utility classes for generated content (prose) 
  instead of typography plugin

### Fix

- [x] Seo component server side rendering (getting hydration warnings now)
- [x] a11y issue due to nesting non `li` in `ul` in `NavPrimary` component
- [x] for some reason local lighthouse seo test is 100% on github build while 
  robots.txt has disallow and meta tag with noindex nofollow is set. Would 
  expect a failure like when running on the netlify build.
- [ ] image sync is based on image name > same image name but different 
  image is not detected

### Refactor

- [x] merge Hero and HeroImage components

  - [x] provide log to report for local use
  - [ ] decide on using custom logging or letting lighthouse do it

### Documentation

- [ ] update README.md with latest changes
- [ ] add a CHANGELOG.md file (possible integrate conventional commits to 
  automate)

### CI/CD

- [x] balance speed and reliability
- [x] cleanup by splitting steps into templates
~~- [ ] cache cms images in pipeline to avoid downloading them every time~~
- [ ] add a test job (once vitest or playwright tests are added)
- [x] optimize flow
	- for different scenarios
    - for when site is launched

### Security

- [ ] add security checks
- [x] check desired cors settings
