Originally from Greece, I’ve lived in the Netherlands for over 15 years, giving me a unique perspective on the experiences of internationals and expats. That said, I work with people from all walks of life, offering a safe and supportive space for anyone seeking change.\n\nMy approach is practical and collaborative. I combine curiosity with empathy to help clients explore their challenges and find ways forward. You don’t need to be perfect or have all the answers—therapy is about working together to create clarity and change.\n\n## Why Systemic Therapy?\nSystemic therapy focuses on the patterns and systems we live in, rather than labeling or diagnosing individuals. It’s not about finding fault but about exploring how dynamics work and where we can make meaningful shifts. My role is to guide you in uncovering possibilities and building solutions that fit your life."
