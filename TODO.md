### Fixes

- [ ] Seo component server side rendering (getting hydration warnings now)
- [x] a11y issue due to nesting non `li` in `ul` in `NavPrimary` component
- [x] for some reason local lighthouse seo test is 100% on github build while 
  robots.txt has disallow and meta tag with noindex nofollow is set. Would 
  expect a failure like when running on the netlify build.

  automate)

### CI/CD

- [ ] cache cms images in pipeline to avoid downloading them every time
- [ ] add a test job (once vitest or playwright tests are added)
- [x] optimize flow
	- for different scenarios
    - for when site is launched

### Security
