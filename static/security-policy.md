# Security Policy

## Introduction

At **Mikrouli**, we take the privacy and security of our clients seriously.
While we do not offer bounties for security research, we welcome responsible
disclosures of any security vulnerabilities that may impact our website,
systems, or client data.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue that affects our website or services, please
report it responsibly by contacting us at:

- **Email:** [security@mikrouli.nl](mailto:security@mikrouli.nl)

Please **do not** publicly disclose security vulnerabilities until we have had a
reasonable opportunity to investigate and address them.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- Our official website: [https://mikrouli.nl](https://mikrouli.nl)
- Any online forms or portals used for scheduling or inquiries

This policy **does not** apply to:

- Third-party platforms we use for scheduling, payments, or video calls (e.g.,
  Zoom, Stripe, etc.)
- Personal social media accounts

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that security researchers:

- **Do not exploit or abuse vulnerabilities** beyond what is necessary to
  demonstrate the issue.
- **Do not access, modify, or delete data** that does not belong to you.
- **Do not conduct testing that could impact service availability** (e.g., DoS
  attacks).
- **Give us a reasonable time to respond** before sharing any findings publicly.

## Our Commitment

If you report a valid security issue in good faith, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days**.
- Investigate the issue and provide updates on our findings.
- Work to resolve the vulnerability as quickly as possible.

## No Compensation Policy

As a small business, we **do not** offer bug bounties, financial rewards, or
other compensation for security disclosures. However, we appreciate the efforts
of security researchers who help keep our systems safe.

## Changes to This Policy

This security policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will
always be available at:
